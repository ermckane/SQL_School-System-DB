-- Plan for populating School_Enrollment. What pieces I need to fill table
-- 1) Take DOB of from each Student in Student_Info and subtract it from current date  **SOLVED**
-- 2) Group zipcodes for middle school and high schools.
-- 3) If they are between certain ages 18-15, they are in High School, 14-12 Middle School, and 11-5 Elementary  **SOLVED**
-- 4) Put them in the correct school based off of correpsonding zipcode.
